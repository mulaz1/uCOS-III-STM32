Micrium μC/OS-III™ Real Time Operating System porting to STM32F446RE MCU

The goal of this project is to try to port Micrium to Arm Cortex™ M4 MPU, we also designed a PCB shield with some add-ons (like TFT 2.4" display, LEDs, Buttons and Buzzer) in order to create some example of task execution using these devices.
